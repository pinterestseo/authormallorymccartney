<p>The goal is to offer comfort, not to fix the situation.  Keep your message concise, sincere, and respectful of the individual's grief.  Avoid offering unsolicited advice or minimizing their loss.  Allow them space to grieve, and let your message be a quiet testament to your care and support.  Remember to choose your method of delivery thoughtfully – a handwritten card often feels more personal, but a phone call might be appropriate if you have a close relationship with the bereaved.</p>
