<p>The power of collective sympathy should not be underestimated. A group condolence message, signed by friends, family, colleagues, or a community, carries a significant weight of shared sorrow and support.  It demonstrates that many people care and are there for the bereaved during their time of need.  It is important to maintain a consistent tone throughout a group message, ensuring that it conveys genuine compassion without being overly sentimental or impersonal.  Consider choosing a representative to draft the message, ensuring it is reviewed and approved by all contributing parties before sending.</p>
