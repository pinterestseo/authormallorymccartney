<p>The delivery of your condolence message is as important as the message itself.  Choose a respectful and sensitive email subject line that clearly indicates the nature of your email without being overly blunt.  For example, instead of "So sorry for your loss," consider something more subtle like "Thinking of you," or "With deepest sympathy."  Ensure your email is free of typos and grammatical errors, reflecting the care you put into your message.  Keep the tone sincere and empathetic, avoiding any attempt to minimize their grief or offer unsolicited advice.  Your primary goal is to offer comfort and support, allowing the bereaved to process their emotions at their own pace.</p>
