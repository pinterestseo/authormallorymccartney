They offer a lifeline of support, acknowledging the grief and letting the bereaved know they are not alone in their sorrow.  Expressing sympathy, even briefly, can be incredibly meaningful, demonstrating empathy and providing a small measure of comfort amidst overwhelming despair.  It's crucial to approach these messages with utmost care, choosing words that are gentle, sincere, and respectful, avoiding clichés and focusing on genuine empathy.

Keep the message brief and focused on offering sympathy and support.  Avoid offering unsolicited advice or trying to explain the loss; simply acknowledge their pain and offer your presence.  Focusing on the memory of the child, if appropriate, can also be a source of comfort.</p>
