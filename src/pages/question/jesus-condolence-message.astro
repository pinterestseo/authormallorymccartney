<p>The art of offering condolences lies in expressing heartfelt sympathy while respecting the grieving process.  Avoid overly formal language; genuine emotion is paramount.  Choose words that reflect the unique relationship you had with the deceased, acknowledging their life and impact.  Timing is also key; a timely message shows thoughtfulness, while waiting too long might diminish its impact. Remember, the goal is to offer comfort and support, not to offer solutions or minimize their grief.</p>
