<p>The delivery of a condolence message should be handled with sensitivity.  Whether written or spoken, the message should be sincere and heartfelt, avoiding clichés or platitudes.  Consider the relationship you had with the deceased and the bereaved, tailoring your message accordingly.  A handwritten note often feels more personal than a digital message, especially for close family members.  If delivering in person, be prepared for an emotional response, offering a listening ear and gentle presence alongside your words of comfort. Timing is also important; sending your message promptly demonstrates your care, but be mindful of immediate funeral arrangements or intense emotional periods.</p>
