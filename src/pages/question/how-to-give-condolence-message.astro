<p>The manner in which you deliver your message is almost as important as the words themselves.  Consider the relationship you had with the deceased and the bereaved. A close friend might appreciate a longer, more personal message, whereas a distant acquaintance may find a shorter, more formal expression of sympathy more appropriate.  Remember to be mindful of cultural and religious customs, and always prioritize sincerity and genuine compassion over formality.  Avoid focusing on yourself or offering unsolicited advice; simply allow the bereaved to feel understood and supported.</p>
