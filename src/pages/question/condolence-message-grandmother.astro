<p>The delivery method also matters. A handwritten note, though taking more time, often carries greater weight and personal touch.  Email or a phone call can be suitable for immediate expressions of sympathy, but a personalized card remains a cherished keepsake.  Remember to tailor your message to your relationship with the bereaved and the deceased.  Authenticity is key – let your genuine feelings guide your words.</p>
