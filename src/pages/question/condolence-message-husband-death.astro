<p>Crafting a thoughtful condolence message requires sensitivity and care.  Avoid clichés or platitudes, and instead, focus on genuine expressions of sympathy and support.  Consider your relationship with the bereaved when choosing your words; a personal touch is often more comforting than a generic message.  Delivering your message with care is equally important – a handwritten note, a phone call, or a thoughtful email can all be appropriate depending on your relationship and the circumstances.</p>
