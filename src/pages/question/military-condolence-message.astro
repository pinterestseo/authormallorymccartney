<p>Delivering a condolence message requires sensitivity and tact.  Whether written or spoken, your message should be heartfelt and avoid platitudes.  Consider the recipient’s relationship with the deceased and your own connection to them when crafting your message.  A handwritten note often carries more weight than a digital message, particularly for close relationships.  If you are unsure what to say, a simple expression of sympathy is better than silence.  Remember, the goal is to offer comfort and support, not to offer solutions or minimize their pain.</p>
