<p>Choosing the right words can be difficult.  Avoid clichés and generic phrases; instead, aim for authenticity and heartfelt expressions of sympathy. Consider the relationship you had with the deceased and your connection to the recipient of your message.  The delivery method is also important.  A handwritten note often feels more personal and lasting than a digital message, though a timely email or text can also be appropriate depending on your relationship and the circumstances.  Always prioritize sensitivity and respect for the grieving process.</p>
