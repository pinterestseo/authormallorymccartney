<p>Choosing the right words can be challenging.  Avoid clichés or platitudes. Instead, focus on offering genuine comfort and support.  Keep the message concise yet heartfelt, expressing your sorrow and offering your condolences without overshadowing the bereaved's grief.  Simple expressions of empathy, coupled with an offer of practical help if appropriate, can be far more impactful than elaborate statements.  Remember to avoid unsolicited advice or comparisons, instead focusing on the deceased's positive qualities and the impact they had on the recipient's life.</p>
