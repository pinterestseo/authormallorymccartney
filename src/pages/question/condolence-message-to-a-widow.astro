<p>Sending a thoughtful message shows empathy and respect during this difficult time.  Whether delivered in writing, through a phone call, or in person, your words of comfort can be a source of strength for the bereaved. Remember to prioritize genuine sentiment over elaborate phrasing.  A short, simple message filled with sincere compassion can be far more impactful than a lengthy, impersonal one.  Sending a card alongside a handwritten note can also add a personal touch that enhances the message's impact. Choose a method of delivery that feels natural and comfortable for you, but always aim for a prompt and considerate response to the news.</p>
