<p>The importance of written condolences cannot be overstated.  A handwritten note, or a carefully crafted email, demonstrates a level of thoughtfulness and permanence that a verbal expression may lack.  It offers a tangible representation of empathy that the grieving person can revisit whenever they need a comforting reminder.  Appropriately expressing support involves offering genuine empathy, avoiding clichés, and focusing on the deceased's positive qualities or the relationship shared with the bereaved.  Messages that provide comfort often center on shared memories, offering prayers or hope for healing, and simply acknowledging the profound sadness experienced.</p>
