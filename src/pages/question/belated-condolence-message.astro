<p>The timing of a condolence message is secondary to the sentiment it conveys. While immediate condolences are ideal, a thoughtful message offered later still holds significant value. It shows you cared enough to reach out, acknowledging the loss and offering continued support. A late condolence message should avoid any excuses for the delay and focus instead on expressing genuine sympathy and remembering the deceased fondly. Choose your words carefully, conveying empathy without minimizing their grief.</p>
