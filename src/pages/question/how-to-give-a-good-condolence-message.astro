<p>Losing a loved one is an incredibly difficult experience, leaving a void that words can hardly fill.  Condolence messages, however, serve a vital purpose. They acknowledge the grief, offer support during a vulnerable time, and provide a tangible expression of empathy.  These messages are not meant to fix the pain, but rather to let the bereaved know they are not alone in their sorrow and that their loss is recognized and mourned.</p>
