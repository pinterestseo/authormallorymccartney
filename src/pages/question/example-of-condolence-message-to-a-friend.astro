<p>The etiquette of condolence messages hinges on sincerity and appropriateness.  Avoid overly formal language or religious references unless you're certain they align with the recipient's beliefs.  Focus on celebrating the life of the deceased and acknowledging the impact of their loss.  Your message should be concise, heartfelt, and focused on offering comfort and support to the grieving individual or family. Remember to avoid offering unsolicited advice or minimizing their grief. Your presence and genuine empathy are far more valuable than trying to fix their pain.</p>
