Knowing others care during such a painful period can help alleviate feelings of isolation.  While no words can fully erase the pain of loss, a kind message can be a source of strength and hope.  Proper etiquette involves avoiding insensitive comments, focusing on the deceased's positive qualities, and offering practical support if appropriate.  Above all, sincerity is key.</p>
