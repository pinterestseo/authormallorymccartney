<p>The appropriate tone for a condolence message is one of sincere empathy and respect. Avoid overly formal language or empty platitudes.  Instead, focus on your genuine feelings of sorrow and offer your support in a tangible way.  A simple, heartfelt message is often more powerful than a lengthy, overly sentimental one. Remember to consider your relationship with the bereaved when choosing your words – a close friend or family member might appreciate a more personal and emotional message, while a colleague might prefer something more formal but still genuinely caring.</p>
