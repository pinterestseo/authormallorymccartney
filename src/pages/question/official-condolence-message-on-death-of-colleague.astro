<p>Delivering a heartfelt condolence message requires sensitivity.  Choose your words carefully, avoiding overly formal or impersonal language.  Consider the relationship you had with the deceased and the recipient of the message when selecting appropriate phrasing.  If unsure, a simple and sincere expression of sympathy is always best.  Ensure the message is delivered with care, whether handwritten on quality stationery or sent as a thoughtful email.  Avoid sending mass-produced messages; a personal touch conveys genuine concern.</p>
