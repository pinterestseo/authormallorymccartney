Choose your words carefully, opting for gentle and compassionate language. Whether written or spoken, the message should be delivered with care and sensitivity, ensuring it conveys genuine empathy without adding to the burden of grief.  Consider the recipient's relationship with the deceased and tailor your message accordingly.  Timing is also crucial – a timely message, sent promptly yet thoughtfully, is often more impactful.</p>
