<p>The act of offering condolences shows you care and remember the deceased and the grieving person. It’s a small gesture that can provide immense comfort during an overwhelming period of loss.  While there’s no perfect formula, aiming for authenticity and avoiding platitudes is crucial.  A simple, heartfelt message can be far more effective than a lengthy, insincere one. Remember to be mindful of cultural and religious sensitivities.</p>
