<p>Choosing the right words can feel overwhelming, but sincerity is key.  Avoid overly formal language; instead, opt for words that feel natural and heartfelt.  Consider your relationship with the bereaved when selecting your phrases.  A close friend may receive a more personal message than a distant acquaintance.  Delivering your message, whether handwritten or via email or card, should be done with care and consideration. Timing is important – allow time for immediate grief to subside before reaching out.  A thoughtful, well-crafted message can offer a lifeline during a difficult time.</p>
