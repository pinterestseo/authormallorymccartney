<p>The appropriateness of your message hinges on your relationship with the deceased and their family or friends. A formal tone is suitable for professional acquaintances, while close relationships allow for greater warmth and personal reminiscence.  Regardless of your closeness, maintaining a respectful, compassionate, and sincere tone is paramount. Avoid lengthy messages; brevity often speaks volumes in expressing genuine sorrow. Focus on offering support and acknowledging the significance of the loss.  Remember, your presence, even through a simple message, can make a significant difference during this painful time.</p>
