These messages, though brief, acknowledge the pain, validate the loss, and offer a sense of connection in a time of isolation.  Expressing sympathy, even through a simple message, demonstrates care and respect, helping the bereaved feel less alone in their sorrow.  It's crucial to choose words carefully, ensuring your message is sincere, respectful, and delivered with sensitivity, considering the relationship you had with the deceased and the recipient.  Avoid clichés or platitudes, and opt for genuine expressions of empathy and support. The method of delivery should also be considered; a handwritten note often feels more personal than a digital message, though a phone call can offer immediate emotional support in some cases."
