<p>The etiquette surrounding condolence messages involves choosing words that are both heartfelt and appropriate. Avoid clichés or platitudes, instead opting for genuine expressions of sympathy and empathy.  Focus on the positive qualities of the deceased, sharing cherished memories if appropriate.  The method of delivery should also be considered; a handwritten note often feels more personal than a digital message, though a timely email or text message is acceptable in some circumstances.  Remember, the goal is to offer comfort and support, not to minimize the pain of loss.</p>
