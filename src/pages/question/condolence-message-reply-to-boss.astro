<p>The loss of a loved one is a profoundly difficult experience, leaving a void that impacts every aspect of life.  Offering condolences is a way to acknowledge this pain and offer support during an intensely challenging time.  A well-crafted message demonstrates empathy and respect, letting the bereaved know they are not alone in their sorrow.  Choosing the right words, delivered with sensitivity, can provide solace and comfort during this period of mourning.  Consider the relationship you have with your boss and choose a tone that reflects that connection while always maintaining professionalism and respect.  Avoid clichés and instead focus on genuine feelings of sympathy and support.</p>
<p>Delivering your message requires care.  A handwritten note often feels more personal and thoughtful, especially in situations of significant loss.  Emails are acceptable for a more immediate expression, but a follow-up handwritten note can be a powerful gesture.  No matter the method, ensure your message is free of typos and expresses your sentiments clearly and concisely.  Timing is also important—reaching out promptly is generally appreciated, but allow for some time if the immediate aftermath is chaotic.</p>
