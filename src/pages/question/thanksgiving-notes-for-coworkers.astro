<p>Thanksgiving, a time for reflection and gratitude, takes on a special meaning in the workplace.  While primarily focused on family and close friends, acknowledging your coworkers during this holiday season fosters a stronger team spirit and shows appreciation for their contributions throughout the year.  These notes aren't just about formality; they're about building camaraderie and creating a positive work environment.  The tone should be warm, genuine, and professional, reflecting the collaborative spirit of a shared workplace.  Delivery methods can range from a simple email to a handwritten note, depending on your company culture and relationship with the recipient.  Personal touches, such as mentioning a specific shared accomplishment or inside joke, will make the message even more impactful.</p>
