<p>The goal is to offer solace, not to solve the problem of grief.  Simplicity and sincerity are key.  Avoid lengthy theological debates or unsolicited advice.  Instead, focus on acknowledging the loss, offering comfort, and reminding the recipient of God's love and enduring presence.  Remember to keep your focus on the person grieving, offering a listening ear and a shoulder to lean on in the days, weeks, and months to come.</p>
