<p>Remember to be genuine and avoid clichés.  Keep the focus on offering comfort and support, rather than focusing on yourself or your own experiences.  A heartfelt, brief message is often more effective than a lengthy, overly formal one.  Consider the recipient's relationship with their father and tailor your message accordingly.  Whether sent via card, email, or in person, ensure your message is delivered with sensitivity and respect for their grieving process.</p>
