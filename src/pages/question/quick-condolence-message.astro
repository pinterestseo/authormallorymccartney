<p>The delivery method is as important as the message itself.  A handwritten note often feels more personal and enduring, but a heartfelt email or text message can also provide immediate comfort.  Regardless of the method, ensure your message is delivered with sensitivity and respect, prioritizing the feelings of the bereaved above all else.  Remember, the goal is to offer support and understanding during a time of immense sadness.</p>
