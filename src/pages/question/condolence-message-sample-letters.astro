Avoid overly lengthy or preachy messages; instead, focus on expressing your heartfelt sympathy and offering support.  Consider the recipient's relationship to the deceased and tailor your message accordingly. A simple, sincere expression of sorrow can be far more comforting than elaborate phrases. Remember to keep the focus on the deceased and their positive impact, offering comfort and hope to the bereaved.</p>
