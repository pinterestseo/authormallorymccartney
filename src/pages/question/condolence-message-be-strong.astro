<p>The importance of expressing sympathy cannot be overstated. A simple, sincere message can make a world of difference to someone grappling with grief.  Etiquette dictates that condolences should be offered promptly, whether through a written note, email, or phone call.  Avoid overly formal language; genuine empathy should shine through.   Delivering the message with sensitivity and respect is paramount; consider the recipient's relationship with the deceased and tailor the message accordingly.  Focus on offering comfort and acknowledging their pain rather than offering unsolicited advice or minimizing their loss.</p>
