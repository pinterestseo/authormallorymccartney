<p>The impact of a well-crafted condolence message can be profound. It validates the bereaved person’s feelings, offering a sense of understanding and support.  Conversely, an insensitive or poorly worded message can add to their burden.  Therefore, careful consideration of your words and the recipient’s context are paramount. Remember, the goal is to offer comfort and support, not to offer solutions or minimize their grief.  Let your message convey genuine empathy and a willingness to be present for the bereaved during this difficult period.</p>
