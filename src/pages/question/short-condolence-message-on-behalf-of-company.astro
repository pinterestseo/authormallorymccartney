<p>The choice of words in a condolence message is crucial.  Avoid overly formal language or generic phrases that lack genuine feeling.  Focus on conveying genuine sympathy and acknowledging the pain of loss.  The message should be brief, but heartfelt, leaving space for the recipient to process their grief without feeling overwhelmed.  Remember to always maintain a respectful tone and avoid offering unsolicited advice or making comparisons to other losses.</p>
