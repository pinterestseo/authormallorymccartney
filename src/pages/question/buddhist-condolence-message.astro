<p>In the Buddhist tradition, the focus often lies on acceptance, impermanence (anicca), and the continuation of consciousness.  Messages should reflect this understanding, offering comfort and strength through acknowledging the loss while also gently pointing towards peace and acceptance.  It’s crucial to avoid words that might minimize their pain or suggest a quick resolution to grief.  Instead, focus on sharing memories of the deceased and expressing hope for their peaceful transition.</p>
