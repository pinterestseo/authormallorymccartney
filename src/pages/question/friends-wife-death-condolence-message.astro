<p>The tone and formality of your message will depend on your relationship with the grieving friend and his family. A handwritten note often feels more personal than an email or text, particularly for close friends or family members.  Regardless of the method, authenticity is paramount.  Choose your words thoughtfully, focusing on offering solace rather than trying to fix the situation.  Remember to keep the focus on the deceased and their positive impact.</p>
