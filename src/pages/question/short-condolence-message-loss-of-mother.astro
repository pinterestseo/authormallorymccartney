<p>The way you deliver your message is as important as its content.  A handwritten note often feels more personal and thoughtful than a digital message, though a well-crafted email or text can also be appropriate, especially if distance makes a personal visit impossible.  Always ensure your message is sincere, respectful, and focuses on offering comfort and support rather than self-expression.  Avoid offering unsolicited advice or minimizing their grief.  Simply offering your presence and sincere condolences can make a significant difference.</p>
