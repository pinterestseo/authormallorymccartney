Instead, focus on expressing your sincere sorrow and offering practical assistance if appropriate.  Remember, the message should be about offering comfort to the recipient, not about yourself or your own experiences. Even a simple, heartfelt message can provide profound comfort and remind the bereaved that they are not alone in their sorrow.</p>
