Avoid overly formal language, but maintain a level of decorum appropriate for the situation.  While heartfelt emotion is key, it’s also important to avoid burdening the grieving with unsolicited advice or lengthy narratives.  Keep your message concise, focused, and genuine.  Remember, the goal is simply to offer comfort and support during a time of profound loss.</p>
