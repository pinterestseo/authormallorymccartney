<p>Proper etiquette dictates that condolence messages should be delivered with care and consideration.  Avoid clichés and overly formal language; instead, opt for heartfelt expressions of sympathy and support.  Timing is crucial, although sometimes messages may be late due to unforeseen circumstances. Even a delayed message of comfort can still provide solace. The message should be sincere, brief, and focused on offering comfort and acknowledging the loss. Whether sent via a card, email, or personal note, the intention should always be to offer genuine support during this difficult time.</p>
