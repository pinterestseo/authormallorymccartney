<p>The tone of your condolence should be respectful, compassionate, and sincere. Avoid clichés or platitudes that may sound insincere. Instead, focus on expressing your genuine sorrow and offering words of support. Remember, your message is meant to offer comfort, not to solve the problem of grief.  It’s okay to keep it brief and heartfelt, allowing the bereaved to process their feelings at their own pace.</p>
