<p>The delivery method is also important. A handwritten note, while taking more time, often feels more personal and heartfelt.  An email or text message can be appropriate for less formal relationships or when immediate support is needed, but should still be thoughtfully composed. Regardless of the method, avoid clichés and overly formal language.  Focus on genuine emotion and a sincere expression of sympathy.  Let your words reflect the unique relationship you shared with the deceased or the bereaved.</p>
