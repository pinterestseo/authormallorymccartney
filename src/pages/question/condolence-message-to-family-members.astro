<p>Choosing the right words can be challenging, but the effort itself holds immense value.  The goal is to convey genuine sorrow and offer comfort without minimizing their grief or offering unsolicited advice.  Remember to keep the focus on the deceased and their positive impact. Avoid making comparisons or bringing up other losses.  Let your message reflect the unique relationship you had with the deceased or the family. The tone should always be respectful and comforting, offering a sense of peace during a profoundly difficult time.</p>
