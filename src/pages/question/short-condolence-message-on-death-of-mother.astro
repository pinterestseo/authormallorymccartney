Expressing sympathy, even briefly, demonstrates that you care and remember the deceased, and that you stand beside the bereaved in their grief.

<p>Delivering a condolence message requires thoughtful consideration.  Avoid generic phrases that lack personal touch. Instead, personalize your message to reflect your relationship with the deceased or the bereaved.  Whether you knew the mother well or are a distant acquaintance, sincerity is paramount.  Timing is also crucial; a timely message acknowledges the immediate grief while a follow-up message a few weeks later can offer continued support during the longer healing process.   Avoid lengthy or overly sentimental messages; brevity and heartfelt sincerity are key.</p>
