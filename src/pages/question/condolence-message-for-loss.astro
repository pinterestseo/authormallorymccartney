<p>The etiquette surrounding condolence messages involves thoughtful consideration.  A simple, heartfelt message is far more powerful than a lengthy, overly formal one.  Avoid using phrases that minimize the loss or suggest a quick resolution to grief.  Instead, focus on expressing your understanding of their pain and offering your unwavering support.  Whether you knew the deceased personally or are offering condolences as a friend of the family, genuine compassion shines through.  Timely delivery is important; a prompt message is more impactful than a delayed one.  Choose a method that feels most appropriate for your relationship with the bereaved.</p>
