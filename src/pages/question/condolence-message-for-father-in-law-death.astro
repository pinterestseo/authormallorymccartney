<p>The tone and style of your condolence message should reflect your relationship with the deceased and the bereaved. A formal message might be suitable for a colleague's father-in-law, while a more personal message works best for close family.  Regardless, sincerity and genuine compassion are always essential.  Consider the recipient's preference when deciding on the method of delivery.  A handwritten note often feels more personal than a digital message, but a quick text or email might be more appropriate in certain circumstances.</p>
