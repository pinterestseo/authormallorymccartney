<p>It's essential to approach writing a condolence message with sensitivity and genuine empathy. Avoid clichés or platitudes that might feel dismissive of the depth of their sorrow.  Instead, focus on offering sincere support, acknowledging their loss specifically, and providing words of comfort.  Whether delivered by handwritten note, email, or card, ensure the message is delivered respectfully and promptly.  A timely message often holds greater comfort than one delayed.</p>
