<p>Sending a thoughtful condolence message requires sensitivity and consideration.  Avoid clichés or generic phrases; instead, aim for genuine and heartfelt expressions that reflect your personal connection to the deceased or the bereaved.  The tone should be respectful, compassionate, and supportive.  The method of delivery should be carefully considered; a handwritten note often feels more personal than an email, especially for close family, while a phone call might be appropriate for close friends.  Remember to always keep the recipient's feelings at the forefront.</p>
