It allows for a more thoughtful and considered expression of empathy, and it can be reread countless times as a source of comfort in the days, weeks, and even months ahead.  Appropriate ways to express support include acknowledging the loss, offering practical assistance, sharing a fond memory of the deceased, and simply letting the grieving person know you’re thinking of them.</p>
