<p>Crafting a heartfelt condolence message requires sensitivity and care.  Avoid clichés and focus on expressing genuine feelings.  Keep the tone respectful and comforting, offering support rather than offering unsolicited advice.  Whether writing in a condolence book or sending a personal note, ensure your message is delivered with thoughtfulness and consideration.  Handwritten messages often feel more personal and sincere.</p>
