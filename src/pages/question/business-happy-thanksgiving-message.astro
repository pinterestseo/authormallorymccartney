<p>Traditionally, Thanksgiving is celebrated with a focus on family gatherings, feasts, and expressions of thankfulness.  Sharing gratitude extends beyond the dinner table, though; heartfelt messages are a powerful way to convey appreciation. Whether sent via email, social media, or even a handwritten note, these messages should be genuine, respectful, and reflect your company's values.  Avoid overly promotional language; instead, prioritize sincerity and warmth.  A personal touch, such as mentioning a specific achievement or collaboration, elevates the message beyond a generic greeting.</p>
