<p>The delivery of your message is equally crucial.  Whether a handwritten note, a heartfelt email, or a brief phone call, ensure your words are delivered with sensitivity and respect for the grieving person's emotional state.  Timing is important; sending a message promptly shows immediate care, but don't hesitate to reach out later to offer continued support.  Avoid overwhelming the bereaved with lengthy messages; brevity and sincerity are key.</p>
